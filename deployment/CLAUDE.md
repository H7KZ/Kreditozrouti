## deploy.sh

```bash
./deploy.sh prod production    # production
./deploy.sh dev development    # staging
```

Requires `.env` (secrets) and `.images` (CI-written: `IMAGE_REGISTRY`, `IMAGE_PREFIX`, `IMAGE_TAG`).

## Critical Invariants

**Deploy order on a fresh server:** Traefik → GlitchTip (optional) → GitHub Runner (optional) → app stack. Traefik must
exist before any app stack because it creates `traefik-network`.

**`deployment/.env` is gitignored.** Secrets never go in compose files. The file lives in `~/variables/.env.prod` on the
VPS and is symlinked or copied into the deployment directory.

**`VITE_*` env vars** are baked into the client image at build time by Vite. Setting them at container runtime has no
effect — the `docker-entrypoint.sh` placeholder-swap handles this at startup instead.

**Redis data is ephemeral** (BullMQ queue + sessions). No named volume for Redis. Only MySQL data is persisted via
`mysql-data-volume`.

**`deploy.sh` uses `$SCRIPT_DIR`** — must be called by path (`./deployment/deploy.sh`) or from within `deployment/`. The
working directory doesn't matter; only the script's own location does.

**MySQL healthcheck** uses `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` — it must be present in `.env`.

**Production vs development** differ in: image tag prefix (`v*` vs `dev-*`), replica counts, network names (
`mysql-network` vs `mysql-dev-network`), volume names.
