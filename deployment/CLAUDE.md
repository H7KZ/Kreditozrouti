## deploy.sh

```bash
./deploy.sh prod production              # full-stack production deploy
./deploy.sh dev development              # full-stack development deploy
./deploy.sh prod production api          # deploy api service only
./deploy.sh prod production client       # deploy client service only
```

Requires `.env` (written by CI from GitHub Secrets — never placed manually) and image tag env vars passed inline.

For single-service deploys, only the relevant tag env var is required (e.g. `API_IMAGE_TAG` for `service=api`). Old
version directories under `$HOME/versions/<environment>/` older than 7 days are cleaned up after each deploy (minimum 3
kept).

## Critical Invariants

**Deploy order on a fresh server:** Traefik → monitoring stack (optional) → GitHub Runner (optional) → app stack.
Traefik must
exist before any app stack because it creates `traefik-network`.

**`.env` is written by CI, never committed.** `_deploy-service.yml` and `deploy-all.yml` construct it from GitHub
Environment secrets/variables and write it into the version directory (`~/versions/<env>/<sha>/.env`) before calling
`deploy.sh`.

**`VITE_*` env vars** are baked into the client image at build time by Vite. Setting them at container runtime has no
effect — the `docker-entrypoint.sh` placeholder-swap handles this at startup instead.

**Redis data is persisted** via a named Docker volume (`redis-data-volume` in production, `redis-data-dev-volume` in
development). Redis runs with AOF persistence (`--appendonly yes`) and `noeviction` policy so sessions and queue jobs
are never silently dropped.

**Both MySQL and Redis require named volumes to be created on the host before first `docker compose up`.** Production:
`docker volume create mysql-data-volume && docker volume create redis-data-volume`. Development:
`docker volume create mysql-data-dev-volume && docker volume create redis-data-dev-volume`.

**`deploy.sh` uses `$SCRIPT_DIR`** — must be called by path (`./deployment/deploy.sh`) or from within `deployment/`. The
working directory doesn't matter; only the script's own location does.

**MySQL healthcheck** uses `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` — it must be present in `.env`.

**Production vs development** differ in: float tag (`latest` vs `dev-latest`), replica counts, network names (
`mysql-network` vs `mysql-dev-network`), volume names. Both use `${GITHUB_SHA::8}` as the versioned tag.
